# Machine Learning final project

My project is using a dataset from Kaggle, originally from the National Health Insurance Service of Korea. It has body signal data of around 1 million randomly selected individuals each year and their smoking and drinking habits. 

My aim is to build a model to predict, based on their body signals, if they drink,or if they smoke or maybe do both.
